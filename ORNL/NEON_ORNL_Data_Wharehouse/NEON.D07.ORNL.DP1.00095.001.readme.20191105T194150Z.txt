DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00095.001

Name: Soil CO2 concentration

Description: CO2 concentration in soil air at various depth below the soil surface starting at 2 cm. Data are from all five Instrumented Soil Plots per site and presented as 1-minute and 30-minute averages.

NEON Science Team Supplier: TIS

Abstract: CO2 concentrations are measured at different depths in the soil to allow the gradient method to be used to estimate soil CO2 efflux rates when combined with other NEON data products. Soil CO2 efflux is an important component of the carbon cycle because it is one of the largest exchanges of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. In addition, since the vast majority of soil CO2 is produced by microbial, root and soil faunal respiration, soil CO2 efflux is an indicator of total soil biological activity. CO2 concentrations are measured in all five Instrumented soil plots per terrestrial site and at various depths below the soil surface starting at approximately 2 cm and data are presented as 1-minute and 30-minute averages. CO2 sensors at different depths within a soil plot are typically located within 1 m horizontally of one another. The CO2 concentration of soil air is measured at three depths within each plot, starting at approximately 2 cm.

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.

Brief Design Description: When possible the plots were arranged in a transect with the first plot approximately 15-40 m from the tower in the expected dominant airshed. The middle of airshed was used as the transect vector and plot spacing was based on the distance required for surface soil temperature and moisture measurements to be spatially independent at the 1 hectare scale during site characterization (capped at approximately 40 m due to logistical constraints). Soil plots were microsited as necessary to avoid obstacles (e.g., boulders, streams, and paths) and more compact plot layouts were used at small sites. The CO2 concentration of soil air is measured at three depths within each plot, starting at approximately 2 cm. The depths of the two deeper sensors vary among sites and were chosen based on megapit soil horizon data (NEON.DP1.00097), expected soil CO2 concentration, and ecosystem type (see NEON.DOC.003146).

Brief Study Area Description: Soil CO2 concentration is measured in all five instrumented soil plots at each terrestrial site.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API.

NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv

The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information.

General conventions, used for all data products:
   NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI.

   DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20).

   SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code.

   DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;

   PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog).

   REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new.

   HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005. 

   VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505. 

   TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year.

   DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table.

   YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file.

   PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below).

   GENTIME: the date-time stamp when the file was generated, in UTC. The format of the date-time stamp is YYYYMMDDTHHmmSSZ.

Time stamp conventions:
   YYYY: Year
   YY: Year, last two digits only
   MM: Month: 01-12
   DD: Day: 01-31
   T: Indicator that the time stamp is beginning
   HH: Hours: 00-23
   mm: Minutes: 00-59
   SS: Seconds: 00-59
   Z: Universal Time Coordinated (Universal Coordinated Time), or UTC

Issue Date: 2019-04-19
Issue: Mole hills (or other small mammal burrows) located close to this soil CO2 sensor appeared between 1 and 18 April, with a large spike in CO2 concentrations corresponding to these times indicating that the measurements may have been affected by mammal respiration and are not representative of typical soil conditions.
       Date Range: 2019-04-17 to 2019-04-18
       Location(s) Affected: D16 ABBY soil plot 3 measurement level 2 (HOR.VER: 003.502)
Resolution Date: 2019-04-19
Resolution: No action taken. CO2 concentrations returned to typical levels, presumably because the small mammal had left the area close to the sensor.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed. 
 
Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.
